This file aims to create poisoned datasets including IMDB, YELP, SST2 for rare-word-based attacks. Before running the trigger_plant.py, you need to set the directory
structure like: 

+--data

    +--rare_word_attack
  
    +--imdb
    
    +--sst2
    
    +--yelp
    
You can also customize your poisoned data path in the code.
